   ```
   Choose between API key or email authentication methods.

2. **Initialize a new skill project:**
   ```bash
   lua init
   ```
   Select your organization and agent, then provide skill details.

3. **View your API key:**
   ```bash
   lua apiKey
   ```

   lua agents
   ```

5. **Delete your stored credentials:**

## Commands

### `lua configure`

Set up your authentication credentials. You can choose between:

- **API Key**: Direct API key input
- **Email**: Email-based OTP authentication

```bash
lua configure
```

### `lua init`

Initialize a new Lua skill project in the current directory.

```bash
lua init
```

This command will:
- Fetch your organizations and agents from the API
- Let you select an organization by name
- Let you choose an agent from the selected organization
- Prompt for skill name and description
- Create a `lua.skill.toml` configuration file
- Copy template files to the current directory

### `lua apiKey`

Display your stored API key (with confirmation prompt).

```bash
lua apiKey
```

### `lua agents`

Fetch and display your agents from the HeyLua API.

```bash
lua agents
```

### `lua destroy`

Delete your stored API key and credentials.

```bash
lua destroy
```

## Configuration File

The `lua.skill.toml` file is created when you run `lua init`:

```toml
[agent]
agentId = "your-agent-id"
orgId = "your-organization-id"

[skill]
name = "Your Skill Name"
description = "Description of your skill"
```

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

1. Run `lua configure`
2. Select "API Key"
3. Enter your API key when prompted
4. The key is validated and stored securely

### Email Authentication

2. Select "Email"
3. Enter your email address

## Security
